Audio Switcher
==============

Audio Switcher is a simple app that runs in the notification area (system tray) and lets you easily switch the default input and output audio devices.

Tired of having to perform a song and dance through the audio dialogs just to switch from your speakers to your headphones? Then this app is for you.
